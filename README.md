NetPulse is a lightweight, high-performance **NOC (Network Operations Center) monitoring dashboard** designed for telecom engineers and network administrators. Built on **.NET 8** and **SignalR**, it performs parallel SNMP/ICMP diagnostics across multiple target routers, maps OID configurations dynamically based on ONT brand profiles, runs automated traceroutes on performance degradation, and features a self-hosted CDN-based internet speed test with a modern, circular progress ring.

## Overview & Architecture

NetPulse operates as a self-contained web application. The backend runs background tasks that scan active network targets in parallel, while SignalR pushes live telemetry directly to the web client.

## Core Features

*   **Parallel ICMP & SNMP Scanning Engine**: Monitors latency, jitter, packet loss, WAN link state, interface speed, and GPON Rx Optical Power (`dBm`) in parallel threads using `Task.WhenAll`.
*   **ONT Profiles Mapper (Dynamic OID Configuration)**: Allows technicians to register and map custom SNMP OIDs per ONT brand (e.g., Huawei, ZTE, Generic MIB-II) dynamically from the UI.
*   **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Plots latency and jitter charts on-the-fly using **Chart.js** over a sliding window of historical metrics.
*   **Auto-Traceroute & NOC Alerting**: Triggers an automatic traceroute tool on performance degradation (e.g., packet loss or latency spikes) to localize the network hop causing congestion, printing live alerts with auto-resolve handlers.
*   **Multi-Target Selector**: Dynamically switch dashboard monitoring targets via a dropdown menu. The UI instantly swaps chart history and diagnostic logs for the active target.
*   **Self-Hosted Speed Test (Needle-less Progress Dial)**: Benchmark download/upload bandwidth capability using a zero-configuration Cloudflare CDN setup. Features a modern, needle-less circular progress ring inspired by Fast.com with dynamic stage indicators and color-coding:
    *   **Red** (< 10 Mbps): Low-bandwidth link.
    *   **Yellow** (10–50 Mbps): Medium-bandwidth link.
    *   **Green** (>= 50 Mbps): High-bandwidth link.
* **Sleek Light/Dark Mode**: Transition entire layouts, charts, forms, and custom badges instantly with a premium glassmorphic visual system.

## Project Structure Highlights

*   [Services/NetworkMonitoringService.cs](file:///d:/wokwos/Services/NetworkMonitoringService.cs): Parallel monitoring daemon loop. Automatically recreates database tables if schema modifications are detected on startup.
*   [Services/SpeedTestService.cs](file:///d:/wokwos/Services/SpeedTestService.cs): Custom HTTP stream handler (`ProgressReportingStream`) that intercepts socket bytes read/write buffers to track download/upload speeds, throttled to 150ms broadcasts to prevent web client congestion.
*   [Services/GatewayDetector.cs](file:///d:/wokwos/Services/GatewayDetector.cs): Auto-detects local default gateway IP addresses natively across platforms.
*   [Program.cs](file:///d:/wokwos/Program.cs): Registers services and configures routes for targets, ONT profiles, and speed test APIs.
